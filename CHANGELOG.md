## Changelog

This is the changelog for the rescomp package

### rescomp 0.3.1
* Fixed ESNGenLoc bug where W_in was setup incorrectly.
* Updated the examples to use the Lorenz-96 system instead of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system where applicable.

### rescomp 0.3.0
* Removed the measures.error_over_time() and measures.valid_time_index() functions introduced in 0.2.4 due to
concerns about their naming. They'll be re-introduced in a later version.

### rescomp 0.2.4
* Added measures.error_over_time() and measures.valid_time_index() as additional error/data validation functions

### rescomp 0.2.3
* Added esn.create_input_matrix() to allow the creation of an input matrix independent from any training.
* Adjusted the arguments of _ESNCore._fit_w_out() to allow for more flexible extension classes built upon _ESNCore 
and/or ESN

### rescomp 0.2.2

* Updated required packages to correctly reflect the oldest supported packages.
* Removed the last matplotlib uses in rescomp.
* Added better testing with tox (and pyenv)
* Added tests for the KS simulation function variants, and marked the (likely) expected to fail tests as such.

### rescomp 0.2.1

* Fixed Bug where the parameter pred_sync_steps was not passed on and used 
incorrectly in the following functions:
   * esn.ESNWrapper.train_and_predict()
   * esn.ESNGenLoc.train_and_predict()
   * utilities.train_and_predict_input_setup()
   
  Directly called predict() functions, the typical use case where an
  additional synchronization is required, are unaffected.
   
### rescomp 0.2.0

* Updated the repositories license from unlicensed to the MIT license

### rescomp 0.1.4

* Added the general local states (GLS) Code
* Added a usage example for the general local states methods

### rescomp 0.1.3

* Rewrote the documentation for gitlab pages
* Rewrote the examples as jupyter files for integration in the new documenation

### rescomp 0.1.2

* Added options to have W_in ordered 
* Implemented squared tanh activation function
* Implemented option to have mixture of activation functions
* Changed the 'b' parameter in the lorenz systems used in 
  rescomp.simulate_trajectory() to 'beta', as that's what the parameter is 
  usually called in the literature

### rescomp 0.1.1

* Allowed kwargs for the Lorenz63 and Roessler systems in simulate_trajectory()
* Added short example for the simulations module usage.
* Rewrote divergence_time to correctly handle perfect predictions and 
  immediate divergence


### rescomp 0.1.0

* Package fundamentally rewritten.

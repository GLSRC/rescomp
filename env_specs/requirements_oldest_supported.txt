# requirement.txt for rescomp testing. Specifies the oldest package versions we support
# Note that the order of packages matters, as that's the order they'll be installed in

# Basics:
numpy == 1.14.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.6, works for higher python version too it seems though
# numpy == 1.16.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.7
# numpy == 1.17.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.8
# numpy == 1.19.3 # officially the min. version for python 3.9

# dask == 2.0.0
# matplotlib == 2.0.0
networkx == 2.0.0 
pandas == 1.0.0 # pandas<1.0 (<=0.25) doesn't reliably work on python 3.9
# pandas == 1.2.0 # pandas<=1.2 (<=0.25, 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2) doesn't reliably work on python 3.9

# Depends on the above:
# numba == 0.40.0
scipy == 1.4.0 # scipy<=1.3 doesn't reliably work on python 3.9. also 1.4.0 added scipy.fft
# skccm==0.2.dev0
scikit-learn == 0.23.0 # scikit-learn<=0.22 doesn't reliably work on python 3.9

# Testing
tox == 3.0.0
pytest == 5.2.0 # pytest<=5.1 has a dependency error with never versions of attrs

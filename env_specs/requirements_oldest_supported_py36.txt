# requirement.txt for rescomp testing. Specifies the oldest package versions we support.
# Note that the order of packages shouldn't matter, but I'm not 100% sure on that.

# numpy == 1.14.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.6, though works for higher python version too it seems
numpy == 1.14.6 # min version that works with scipy 1.4.0
# numpy == 1.16.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.7
# numpy == 1.17.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.8
# numpy == 1.19.3 # officially the min. version for python 3.9

networkx == 2.0.0
pandas == 1.0.0 # In principle we may be able to user older pandas versions, but didn't test that yet

scipy == 1.4.0 # scipy<=1.3 doesn't reliably work on python 3.9. also 1.4.0 added scipy.fft
scikit-learn == 0.20.0

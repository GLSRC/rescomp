# requirement.txt for rescomp testing. Specifies the oldest package versions we support.
# Note that the order of packages shouldn't matter, but I'm not 100% sure on that.

# numpy == 1.14.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.6, works for higher python version too it seems though
# numpy == 1.14.6 # min version that works with scipy 1.4.0
# numpy == 1.16.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.7. Offically the min. version for pandas==1.2.0
numpy == 1.17.5 # officially the min. version for python 3.8. Min. version that works with pandas==1.2.0 on py39
# numpy == 1.19.3 # officially the min. version for python 3.9

networkx == 2.1.0 # networkx 2.0.0 doesn't work with conda in py37/38, for some reason
pandas == 1.2.0 # pandas<1.2 (<=0.25, 1.0, 1.1) doesn't reliably work on python 3.9. Isn't even installable, really

scipy == 1.4.0 # scipy<=1.3 doesn't reliably work on python 3.9. also 1.4.0 added scipy.fft
scikit-learn == 0.23.0 # scikit-learn<=0.22 doesn't reliably work on python 3.9
